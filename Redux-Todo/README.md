Welcome to the **Todo App** built with **React**, **Redux**, and **Chakra UI**! This project is a simple, yet powerful way to manage tasks, with features like adding new tasks, marking them as complete, and deleting them. Built for learning state management with Redux, this app showcases global state handling, conditional rendering, and a clean, modern UI. 🚀
