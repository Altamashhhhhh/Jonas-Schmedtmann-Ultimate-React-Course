# OTP Verification Form 🚀

Welcome to the **OTP Verification Form** project built with React.js! This project showcases a dynamic and user-friendly OTP verification interface. 🎉

## Features ✨

- **Dynamic Input Handling**: Automatically focuses on the next field as digits are entered and handles the Backspace key to focus on the previous field. 🔄
- **Input Validation**: Ensures only single-digit inputs are accepted, with real-time error messages for invalid inputs and paste issues. 🚫
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Allows pasting a 6-digit OTP, with each digit auto-allocated to its respective field. Error messages auto-clear after a few seconds. 🌟
- **Form Submission**: Alerts the entered OTP on submission, clears all input fields, and refocuses on the first field. ✅
- **Button Enable/Disable**: The submit button is enabled only when all fields are correctly filled. 🟢
