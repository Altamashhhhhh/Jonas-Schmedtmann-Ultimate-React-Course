## 📚 Project Overview

This project is a **responsive product grid** built using **React** and **Chakra UI**, which fetches data from an external API using **Axios**. The product data is dynamically displayed in a grid layout that adjusts based on screen size, providing a great user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 🚀 Features

- Fetch product data from an API using Axios
- Display products in a responsive grid using Chakra UI's **SimpleGrid**
- Hover effects for interactive UI
- Adaptable layout with **1, 2, 3, or 4 columns** based on the screen width

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React**: For building the UI components
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to fetch data
- **Chakra UI**: For responsive and easy-to-use UI components

## 🎯 What We Learned

1. **API Integration**: Using Axios to fetch data from an external source and store it in React's state using `useState` and `useEffect`.
2. **Responsive Design**: Leveraging Chakra UI’s `SimpleGrid` component to create a grid layout that adjusts to different screen sizes.
3. **Component Structure**: Building reusable and clean components in React for better project scalability.
4. **Hover Effects**: Adding simple hover effects to improve the user interaction and overall feel of the UI.
